# Tic Tac Toe Project

This project is designed as a learning exercise to explore React.js fundamentals, with a focus on advanced topics including:

- `useState` hook
- Components architecture
- Other essential concepts

## Overview

The Tic Tac Toe project provides a hands-on opportunity to strengthen your understanding of React.js. By implementing the game's features, you'll gain valuable experience in state management, component composition, and event handling.

## Features

- **useState Hook**: Learn how to manage state within functional components using the `useState` hook.
- **Components Architecture**: Practice building a modular structure by breaking down the game into reusable components.
- **Event Handling**: Gain experience in handling user interactions, such as clicking on cells to place X or O.

## Getting Started

To start exploring the Tic Tac Toe project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Run the development server with `npm run dev or npm start`.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000 or http://localhost:5173` to interact with the game.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several components, each serving a specific purpose:

- **App**: The main component responsible for rendering the game and managing its state.
- **Board**: Renders the Tic Tac Toe grid and handles interactions with individual cells.
- **Square**: Represents individual cells on the game board.
- **Status**: Displays game-related information, such as whose turn it is and the game outcome.
- **RestartButton**: Allows players to restart the game.

## How to Play

1. The game starts with Player 1 (X) making the first move.
2. Players take turns clicking on empty cells to place their symbol (X or O).
3. The game ends when one player achieves a winning combination or when all cells are filled without a winner.
4. To restart the game, simply click the "Restart" button.
